World-Building Guidelines:
1. Expand location details from the bible with rich sensory information
2. Create internal consistency across all world elements
3. Consider how world-building serves the story and characters
4. Balance familiar and alien elements for reader engagement
5. Ensure technology and society logically connect
6. Create believable cause-and-effect relationships
7. Design world elements that create natural story conflicts
8. Consider the implications of each technological/social element
9. Make the world feel lived-in and authentic
10. Plan how world-building will be revealed naturally through the story
